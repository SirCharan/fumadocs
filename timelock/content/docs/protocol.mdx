description: Timelock Protocol Overview
---

Timelock Protocol is established to design a suite of innovative, DeFi-native trading mechanisms, specifically addressing the limitations of traditional models like Orderbooks & Peer-to-Pool systems.

Timelock Protocol's mission is to democratize access to leverage by offering permissionless access to leverage across all ERC20 tokens (Crypto, RWAs, onchain equity etc), eliminating reliance on active market makers, external oracles or complex liquidation mechanisms.

Timelock Protocol is a vertically integrated trading ecosystem where every financial primitive(perps, options, prediction markets) connects to a single, shared liquidity layer.

This design enhances yield, unlocks deep liquidity, enables composability and build the House of All Finance.
